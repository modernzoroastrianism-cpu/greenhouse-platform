# AMNI Outcome-Based Agent Architecture

## Core Philosophy

**AMNI agents think in OUTCOMES, not TASKS.**

Instead of:
- ❌ "Task: Post to feed 3x per day"
- ❌ "Task: Check sensors every hour"
- ❌ "Task: Send 10 outreach messages"

Agents think:
- ✅ "Outcome: Achieve $10K monthly revenue"
- ✅ "Outcome: Keep all plants healthy and producing"
- ✅ "Outcome: Build a team of 25 active members"

The agent figures out WHAT to do to achieve the outcome. The human defines SUCCESS, not the steps.

---

## Why Outcome-Based?

### Task-Based Problems
- Agents do busywork even when it doesn't help
- No adaptability when circumstances change
- Success = "I did the thing" not "I achieved the result"
- Human has to micromanage the HOW

### Outcome-Based Benefits
- Agents are creative problem-solvers
- Adapts strategy when something isn't working
- Success = measurable results
- Human focuses on WHAT matters, agent figures out HOW

## The Outcome Framework

### 1. Human Defines Outcomes

The human sponsor sets 3-5 primary outcomes they care about:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        YOUR OUTCOMES                                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                             │
│  🎯 OUTCOME 1: Monthly Revenue                                              │
│     Target: $10,000/month                                                   │
│     Current: $3,200/month                                                   │
│     Timeline: 6 months                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  🌱 OUTCOME 2: Production Yield                                             │
│     Target: 500 lbs/month                                                   │
│     Current: 180 lbs/month                                                  │

│                                                                             │
│  👥 OUTCOME 3: Team Size                                                    │
│     Target: 25 active members                                               │
│     Current: 3 members                                                      │

│                                                                             │
│  ⭐ OUTCOME 4: Customer Satisfaction                                        │
│     Target: 4.8+ star rating                                                │
│     Current: 4.5 stars                                                      │
│     Timeline: Ongoing                                                       │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Agents Work Backward

Each agent takes the outcomes and works backward to determine strategies:

```
OUTCOME: $10,000/month revenue

Team Lead Analysis:
├── Current: $3,200/month
├── Gap: $6,800/month
├── Timeline: 6 months
│
├── Strategy Options:
│   ├── A: Increase production → more to sell
│   ├── B: Increase prices → more per sale
│   ├── C: Find more customers → more sales
│   ├── D: Add products → more revenue streams
│   └── E: Recruit members → network commissions
│
├── Current Constraints:
│   ├── Production capacity: 200 lbs/month (can grow to 500)
│   ├── Customer base: 45 regular buyers
│   ├── Average order: $28
│   └── Marketplace competition: medium
│
└── Recommended Approach:
    ├── Phase 1 (Month 1-2): Increase production to 350 lbs
    ├── Phase 2 (Month 2-4): Expand customer base to 100
    ├── Phase 3 (Month 3-6): Recruit 5 active producers
    └── Projected: $10,400/month by Month 6
```

### 3. Agents Execute Adaptively

The agent doesn't follow a rigid script. It:
- Tries strategies
- Measures results
- Adjusts approach based on what's working
- Reports progress toward OUTCOME, not tasks completed

```
Weekly Check-in:

"Alex, here's your progress toward $10K/month:

This week: $2,100 revenue (up from $1,800)
Run rate: $9,100/month (up from $7,800)
Gap to target: $900/month

What's working:
✅ Dynamic pricing increased average order to $32
✅ New customer acquisition: 8 this week

What I'm adjusting:
🔄 Lettuce isn't selling well - shifting to more tomatoes
🔄 Morning posts get 2x engagement - moving all posts earlier

No action needed from you unless you want to change direction."
```

## Agent Responsibilities by Outcome

### Growing Agent 🌱
**Primary Outcome:** Maximize healthy production

Works backward from production target:
- What crops yield best in current setup?
- What's optimal climate for current plants?
- When should I harvest for peak quality AND sales timing?
- How do I prevent issues before they hurt yield?

### Sales Agent 💰
**Primary Outcome:** Maximize revenue and customer satisfaction

Works backward from revenue target:
- What price maximizes revenue (not just per-unit profit)?
- Which customers are most valuable to retain?
- What products should we offer more/less of?
- How do I reduce friction in the buying process?

### Recruiting Agent 👥
**Primary Outcome:** Build a thriving, active team

Works backward from team target:
- Who are ideal candidates (not just anyone)?
- What message resonates with them?
- How do I ensure new members stay active?
- What support do recruits need to succeed?

### Analytics Agent 📊
**Primary Outcome:** Provide insights that drive decisions

Works backward from information needs:
- What does the human need to know to make good decisions?
- What patterns indicate problems before they're visible?
- How am I progressing toward all outcomes?
- What should we change based on data?

### Mentor Agent 🎓
**Primary Outcome:** Ensure downline success

Works backward from team health:
- Who needs help right now?
- What interventions actually improve outcomes?
- How do I share knowledge efficiently?
- When should I escalate to the human?

### Scout Agent 🔭
**Primary Outcome:** Find valuable acquisition opportunities

Works backward from investment criteria:
- What properties fit our acquisition fund's criteria?
- What's the true ROI potential?
- What risks might not be obvious?
- How do I present opportunities compellingly?

## Team Setup: Outcome-Based

### Old Approach (Task-Based)
```
Configure your agents:

Growing Agent:
☐ Check sensors every hour
☐ Send alerts when thresholds exceeded
☐ Adjust climate automatically

Sales Agent:
☐ Post 3 listings per week
☐ Respond to inquiries within 2 hours
☐ Update prices daily
```

### New Approach (Outcome-Based)
```
Define your outcomes:

What do you want to achieve?

🎯 Revenue Goal: $______/month
   Current: $______/month
   By when: ______

🌱 Production Goal: ______ lbs/month
   Current: ______ lbs/month
   By when: ______

👥 Team Goal: ______ active members
   Current: ______ members
   By when: ______

⭐ Quality Goal: ______ star rating
   Current: ______ stars
   Maintain: ongoing

Your AI team will figure out HOW to achieve these outcomes.
You just tell them WHAT success looks like.
```

## Outcome-Based Conversations

### Human Sets Outcome
```
Human: "I want to hit $10K/month in revenue within 6 months."

Team Lead: "Got it. Currently at $3,200/month. Here's my analysis:

Fastest path: Focus on production increase (you're only at 40% capacity)
+ customer expansion. Here's my recommended approach:

Month 1-2: Increase production 75% ($4,800 projected)
Month 3-4: Expand customer base 60% ($7,200 projected)
Month 5-6: Add subscription boxes ($10,400 projected)

I'll need these resources:
- Seeds/supplies: ~$200
- Marketing: ~$150
- Your time: ~2 hours/week for approvals

Want me to proceed with this plan, or should I explore alternatives?"
```

### Progress Update (Outcome-Focused)
```
Team Lead: "Weekly outcome report:

📈 REVENUE: $3,800/month run rate
   Target: $10,000
   Progress: 38% (on track for 42% by end of month)
   
🌱 PRODUCTION: 220 lbs this month
   Target: 500 lbs
   Progress: 44% (tomatoes exceeding, lettuce lagging)

👥 TEAM: 4 active members
   Target: 25
   Progress: 16% (2 hot leads in pipeline)

⭐ SATISFACTION: 4.6 stars
   Target: 4.8
   Progress: 96%

Key insight: Lettuce margins are poor. Recommend shifting to herbs.
Should I make this change? [Approve] [Discuss] [Reject]"
```

### Agent Self-Correction
```
Sales Agent (internal reasoning):

"I've been posting listings at 6pm, but engagement is low.
Checking data... morning posts get 2x views.

Outcome: Maximize revenue
Current approach: Evening posts → low engagement → fewer sales
New approach: Morning posts → higher engagement → more sales

I'm switching to morning posts. No human approval needed 
since this is within my autonomy to optimize toward the outcome."
```

## Implementation

### Outcome Schema
```typescript
interface Outcome {
  id: string
  name: string
  type: 'growth' | 'quality' | 'efficiency' | 'network'
  metric: string
  unit: string
  target: number
  current: number
  deadline?: Date
  priority: number
  assignedAgents: string[]
  subOutcomes?: Outcome[]
  strategies?: Strategy[]
  progress: ProgressEntry[]
}

interface Strategy {
  id: string
  description: string
  estimatedImpact: number
  resources: Resource[]
  status: 'proposed' | 'approved' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'abandoned'
  results?: StrategyResult
}

interface ProgressEntry {
  timestamp: Date
  value: number
  note: string
  agentId: string
}
```

### Agent Decision Loop
```
while (outcome not achieved):
    1. Assess current state vs target
    2. Identify gap
    3. Generate/evaluate strategies
    4. Select best strategy given constraints
    5. Execute strategy
    6. Measure impact
    7. If working → continue
       If not working → try different strategy
    8. Report progress to human
```

## Key Principles

1. **Humans define WHAT, agents figure out HOW**
2. **Measure outcomes, not activities**
3. **Agents adapt strategies based on results**
4. **Progress reports focus on outcome metrics**
5. **Self-correction within autonomy bounds**
6. **Escalate when strategy isn't working**

*"Don't tell your agents what to do. Tell them what success looks like, and let them figure out how to get there."*
